    <h2>Rowan Bible Teachers Association- Tammy </h2>
    <p>The goal of the West Rowan Bible Teaching Association is to support the non-denominational Bible teaching classes in the public schools of Western Rowan county. Support for this program comes through donations and sponsored community events.<br> They
        believe that the Bible taught in a non-sectarian manner should be an option in our schools. Our church is a proud supporter for them. The teachers in this program are paid strictly from the funds raised through these donations and community events.
        These funds cover their salaries and health care insurance. There are currently three teachers serving the schools in the West district including elementary, middle and high school. Fundraisers range from flower sales in the spring, to sweet potato
        sales in the fall and even golf tournaments. Our church contribute to the association through donations and also announcing all the fundraisers and events occurring to help support them. </p>
