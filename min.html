  <h5>Ministries</h5>
  <h2> Prison Ministry</h2>
  <p>We started a weekly prison ministry at Piedmont Correctional Institute in 1999 and it continues till today. 1,000’s have been reached behind bars with the good news of God’s Love and we have witnessed many changed lives and restored families through
    this ministry.</p>
  </ul>
  <h2>Capstone Ministries and Bethany Nursing Home, Card Ministry</h2>
  <p> We support Capstone Ministries now on a monthly bases with paper products ( paper towels, toilet paper, etc.) And we collect items for Christmas for Bethany Nursing Home. Through our Card Ministry, cards are sent out to those who are sick or in the
    hospital or maybe they are going through a hard time.</p>
  <h2>Our Two Missionary Services </h2>
  <p>In addition to supporting the Southern Baptist foreign mission board, we also support other missionaries not associated with the Baptist denomination: Justin and Kristen Raymer (and their children) are working with Africa Inland Mission in Tanzania;
    and Altaf & Eileen Naseem and their son serve in Lahore, Pakistan. <br> <br> More info on Justin and Kristen <a href="https://www.grace-salisbury.com/ministries/mission-support-.html" class="class2">here</a>. <br> <br> Altaf and Eileen Naseem are
    missionaries in the Muslim dominated country of Pakistan. The Naseem’s spread the light of the gospel despite strong opposition. We are blessed to pray for and support this important mission and evangelistic effort. Check out more info <a href="http://wp.persecutioninpakistan.com/?page_id=9"
      class="class2">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Benevolence Committee </h2>
  <p>The Benevolence committee exists to help families when they have lost a loved one. The committee comes together to prepare a meal for the family. We also set up and serve the family after the funeral. We are also here to help with other needs as well.
  </p>
  <h2>Nursing Home Ministry</h2>
  <p>Headed up by Margret, Carolyn, and Billy Carter. They go and assist at nursing homes nearby.</p>
  <h2>Homeless Shelter</h2>
  <p>Cook and serve warm meals for the Rowan County homeless shelter twice a month. </p>
  <h2>Rowan Bible Teachers Association</h2>
  <p>The goal of the West Rowan Bible Teaching Association is to support the non-denominational Bible teaching classes in the public schools of Western Rowan county. Support for this program comes through donations and sponsored community events.<br> <br>    They believe that the Bible taught in a non-sectarian manner should be an option in our schools. Our church is a proud supporter for them. The teachers in this program are paid strictly from the funds raised through these donations and community events.
    These funds cover their salaries and health care insurance. There are currently three teachers serving the schools in the West district including elementary, middle and high school. Fundraisers range from flower sales in the spring, to sweet potato
    sales in the fall and even golf tournaments. Our church contribute to the association through donations and also announcing all the fundraisers and events occurring to help support them. </p>
