    <h5>Our Services</h5>
    <p>Woodleaf Baptist Church offers worship service at 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Sundays. The service offers singing of praise and expositional preaching/teaching from the Bible delivered in a simple, easy to understand fashion. <br> <br> We also have
        a wonderful nursery service for ages 0 to 24 months during the Sunday morning worship, giving parents the opportunity to worship without having to worry about their small children. Kids age 2 through 6 can attend our Children's Church, led by
        Lisa Robertson. It is a wonderful way for children to experience God's word! Our wonderful teachers go over lessons from the bible on a level that they can understand. They learn songs and do activities that make learning about Jesus fun and exciting.
        <br> <br> Past worship services are available for viewing an our
