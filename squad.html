      We have many exciting things planned for this year. This year we will be starting bear books, to help children learn about God’s word and how to apply it to their own lives. Our group name is “Jesus Squad” and our books are based on Bear Names. First
      year will be Cubs! Followed by Koala, Sloth, Panda, Polar and finally Grizzly. We want to partner with the parents to make each child’s experience a good one. After all, things taught in Jesus Squad are some of the most important things anybody
      can ever know. We will learn about the Bible, about who God is, about God’s Son, Jesus Christ, and about the way God wants us to live our lives. One to two sections each week is all your child needs to do to complete this entire book in a year.
      Let them recite the verses to you to make sure they are memorized, and so you can help with any difficulties. With our books, it is very important to keep working with your child all year. </div>

    <div class="item">
      <p> <img src="images/sloth.PNG" alt="second book"> </p>This book has a lot of important Information. The book is designed for you to complete 1 section per week. If you complete 1 section per week, you will finish this book in one year! When you finish
      a Chapter, you will earn a badge to put on your Jesus Squad Sash! By the end of the year, your sash will be full of Badges you have earned. Throughout the year we will have you wear your sash to church to show off your hard work!! We will review
      the sections in class. If you can recite the work to your Jesus Squad leader, she will sign off on your section and you will earn points for the Jesus Squad Store! When you finish the entire chapter, you earn your badge. You can work ahead or stay
      current each week. At the end of the chapter, we will review to make certain you are remembering your work. Throughout the book, we will also review because this is God’s Word and it is important!!</div>
